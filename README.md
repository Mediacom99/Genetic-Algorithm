# Genetic-Algorithm

This is an example of a Genetic Algorithm got from this website http://www.theprojectspot.com/tutorial-post/creating-a-genetic-algorithm-for-beginners/3.
This Algorithm find a target BYTE STRING starting from a random Element object.
The code contains a few changes made by me but basically 99% of the code is from that website.
Contact me for any question.
